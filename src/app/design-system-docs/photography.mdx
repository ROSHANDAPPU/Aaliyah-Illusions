# Photography Guidelines

This section outlines the guidelines for using photography within the application.

## Image Style

Photography should maintain a consistent, professional aesthetic that aligns with the brand identity. Preferred styles include:

- **Candid**: Natural, unposed shots that capture genuine moments
- **Professional**: High-quality, controlled lighting and composition
- **Vibrant**: Colorful and energetic imagery
- **Minimalist**: Clean, uncluttered compositions focusing on essential elements

Avoid overly staged or artificial-looking photos that feel forced or inauthentic.

## Usage

Photography is used strategically throughout the application to enhance user experience and brand storytelling:

- **Hero Sections**: Large, impactful images to capture attention and set the tone
- **Product Listings**: Clear, well-lit product photography showing details and context
- **Testimonials**: Authentic images of real people or scenarios
- **Background Elements**: Subtle, non-distracting imagery that supports content without overwhelming it

Always ensure images serve a purpose and complement the surrounding text and functionality.

## Technical Specifications

To maintain performance and visual quality across devices:

| Specification | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Format** | JPEG for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency |
| **Aspect Ratios** | 16:9 for hero images, 1:1 for profile/product squares, 4:3 for standard content |
| **File Size** | < 500KB for web images, < 2MB for high-resolution assets |
| **Resolution** | 1920px minimum width for hero images, 800px minimum for content images |
| **Compression** | 80-90% JPEG quality to balance file size and visual quality |
