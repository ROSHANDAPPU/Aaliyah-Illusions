# Accessibility Guidelines

This section provides guidelines to ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## General Principles

### WCAG Compliance

The application adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents

### Semantic HTML

- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) for content structure
- Implement landmark roles for major page sections
- Use semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard
- Tab order should follow logical reading order
- Provide visible focus indicators with sufficient contrast (3:1 ratio minimum)
- Include keyboard shortcuts where appropriate

## Specific Components

### Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `<label>` elements or `aria-label`
- Provide clear error messages that are programmatically associated with form fields
- Use `aria-describedby` to link help text with form controls
- Ensure form validation messages are announced to screen readers

### Navigation

- Include skip links to bypass repetitive navigation
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here" or "read more")
- Provide breadcrumb navigation for complex page hierarchies
- Ensure navigation menus are keyboard accessible and announce state changes

### Interactive Elements

- Buttons should have descriptive text or accessible names
- Use appropriate ARIA states (aria-expanded, aria-selected, etc.)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios:
  - Normal text: 4.5:1
  - Large text: 3:1
  - UI components: 3:1
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

## Testing

### Automated Tools

- **axe-core**: JavaScript library for automated accessibility testing
- **Lighthouse**: Built-in Chrome DevTools accessibility audit
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool

### Manual Testing

- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
- Color contrast verification with tools like Color Contrast Analyzer
- Testing with actual assistive technologies

### Browser Extensions

- axe DevTools Chrome extension
- WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Accessibility Insights for Web

### Regular Audits

Conduct accessibility audits quarterly and after major feature releases to ensure ongoing compliance.
